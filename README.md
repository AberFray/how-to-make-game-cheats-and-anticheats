An open-source learning resource for client side video game cheats and anti-cheats

------------

This is aimed at individuals that have a good grasp of:
- C/C++ programming
- Operating systems and their functionality
- How memory works in a running application

If you are unsure about these topics, then you might be confused by the content of this, so I would recommend researching and learning these first before attempting.

Good resources for learning would be [W3Schools](http://https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp "W3Schools") and [Tutorialspoint.com](http://https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm "Tutorialspoint.com").

------------

This project is mainly split into 2 sections, each with 3 pieces of material for it, with accompanying documentation:
#### Cheats
- Cheats 1: *Bunny hop script*
- Cheats 2: *Wall hack**
- Cheats 3: *Aim hack*

#### Anti-cheats
- Anti-cheats 1: *Running processes scanning*
- Anti-cheats 2: *Code integrity checking*
- Anti-cheats 3: *Bot like consistency detection*

It is intended that the cheats are first seen before going onto the anti-cheats.

There also are introductory and extra discussion segments.

The code was developed using **Visual Studio Community Edition** on **Windows 10** ([Download link](http://https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ "Visual Studio")). And the programs developed will require administrator privileges to run correctly.

**Cheat Engine** was also used throughout the project ([Download link](https://cheatengine.org/downloads.php "Download link"))
