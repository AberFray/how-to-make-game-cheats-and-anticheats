# Introduction

If you came here expecting some cheats for the latest games to just run. Then you are mistaken, but this is something better!

Ever wondered how cheats and anti-cheats work? Well wonder no more! This repository aims to teach people how they operate, at a beginnerâ€™s level. And to be a launching point for more research into the topic.

Despite the basic and fundamentals teaching for the subject, it is still recommended that you familiarize yourself with these subjects:
- C/C++ programming
- Operating systems and their functionality
- How memory works in a running application

Good resources for learning would be [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp "W3Schools") and [Tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm "Tutorialspoint.com").

It is also recommended that an IDE is used to help compile the code and write extra, as this was initially built with Microsoft's Visual Studio Community Edition, it would be a good one to go for ([Download link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ "Visual Studio")).
You should be familiar with how your IDE works as well.

Also as the project uses Cheat Engine in some situations, that would also be recommended to get ([Download link](https://cheatengine.org/downloads.php "Download link")), Although beware of any extra software it "recommends" you install.

Each lesson will explain and demonstrate a topic and concept, with a detailed walkthrough how the needed information before coding starts is acquired, then how code is developed and how it works. Along with the full code being available.

Although this isn't just a resource where you can download the cheats and run them on the game. As the code and documentation have the actual memory addresses used redacted, so it's up to you to find them with the instructions given.

After each lesson (apart from the first one) there will also be a challenge or two for you to improve the code's functionality. With a difficulty rating if you feel confident enough to try it and a hint to set you on the right path.
It is recommended that you read the full set of lessons before you attempt to tackle some of the more complicated ones.

Once ready, then click [here](PROCESSHOOKING.md "Process Hooking") to read the first lesson.
